# picoCTF Writeups

Welcome! I'm a student studying **cybersecurity**, and this repository is my personal space to document my learning journey through solving challenges from **picoCTF**.

## üîç What is picoCTF?

**picoCTF** is a free, beginner-friendly Capture The Flag (CTF) competition created by security experts at **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**. It's designed to teach students and newcomers the basics of cybersecurity, computer systems, reverse engineering, web exploitation, cryptography, forensics, and more.

CTFs like picoCTF simulate real-world hacking scenarios in a legal and educational way. Players solve puzzles and capture "flags" ‚Äî secret strings that prove you've solved a challenge.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is where I:

- Log my solutions to various picoCTF challenges
- Break down the methods, tools, and techniques I use
- Reflect on what I learned from each task
- Share my approach with others who may be learning too

Each folder will contain:
- The challenge name
- The category (e.g., Web Exploitation, Cryptography, Binary Exploitation)
- A detailed writeup of how I solved it
- Any relevant scripts or tools I used

## üõ†Tools and Topics Covered

You'll find a range of topics such as:
- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇForensics
- Web Exploitation
- Cryptography
- Reverse Engineering
- Binary Exploitation
- General Skills (e.g., Linux commands, scripting)

## My Goal

My goal is to:
- Practice real-world security concepts
- Develop problem-solving skills
- Build a strong foundation in ethical hacking
- Create a reference for myself and other learners

I‚Äôm excited to continue learning and documenting my growth here. If you're also learning, feel free to use this repo
