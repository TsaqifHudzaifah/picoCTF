### 🔹Step 1: Launch the Challenge Instance
Click the **"Launch Instance"** button on the challenge page. The description will update with this information:

> *Can you SSH as `ctf-player` to `titan.picoctf.net` at port `53726` to get the flag?  
You'll also need the password `83dcefb7`.  
If asked, accept the fingerprint with `yes`.  
If your device doesn't have a shell, use: https://webshell.picoctf.org*

### 🔹Step 2: Log in as the User

Open your terminal or the provided web shell and use the following SSH command format:

```bash
ssh <username>@<host> -p <port>

This host key is known by the following other names/addresses: <br>
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:1: [hashed name] <br>
